# Project Name
Medical-Image-Enhancement-Noise-Reduction-in-Ultrasound-Images

### Project Description:
#### Summary - 
Overview:
Ultrasound imaging is a widely used, non-invasive technique for medical diagnostics. However, the inherent speckle noise in ultrasound images reduces image quality and obscures critical details, especially in sensitive applications like fetal health monitoring.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a robust image enhancement system that reduces speckle noise in fetal ultrasound images while preserving essential anatomical structures.

Significance:
Enhanced fetal ultrasound images aid healthcare professionals in better diagnosis and monitoring of fetal health, contributing to early detection of abnormalities and improved pregnancy outcomes.
